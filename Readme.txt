Hi All,

WWIIBlitzKrieg is a new Wargame inspired by the old strategic wargames
that were made by SSI. The game perfectly follows the old blizkrieg
battles carried out by Germany between 1939 and 1945.

The first battle is the invasion of Poland which occurred in august 1939
and marked the beginning of WWII. The invasion of Poland proceeded succesfull
until the invasion of Warsaw. The Polish defence, who were waiting for the
English and French armies to attack Germany from the west, were able to
defend Warsaw for a month against the invading Axis forces and were at last
defeated when the Russian troops entered in the East at September 27 1939
with a final death toll of over 20,000 Polish civilians.

This game can be played human-human directly, axis human-allies AI and also
with the favourite style PBEM (play by email) in which the game save-files
are send between 2 human players with email.

The game has been made for a broad audience which is not familiar with tactical
wargames yet. All classic rules are still valid, and explained in the manual,
but the user interface is much more intuitive and easy to play for starters.

When you open the solution in Visual Studio 2008 then don't forget to move all the maps 
(except My Project) to the bin/debug directory when you want to run the code.

Good luck,
Reiniere.
